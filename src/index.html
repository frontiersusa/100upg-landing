      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        In 2014, The Austin Stone Community Church began asking God for a
        greater vision for the unreached. At the same time, God was also giving
        Redeemer Church in Lubbock and The Village Church in Dallas/Ft. Worth an
        even deeper desire to see Jesus known among unreached people groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three different churches. Three different cities. One vision. One
        desire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through much prayer and discernment, these churches linked arms with
        Frontiers, Launch Global, and Reliant Mission to form the 100 UPG
        Cooperative. Together, our vision is to catalyze church planting
        movements among 100 unreached people groups.
